When you try to edit Company Knowledge on a rule or a monitor you need Word installed from Office Professional, not standard professional! And then you need to install “**Visual Studio Tools For Office runtime**”. If you don’t have VSTOR installed you will get the following error:_
  
_ _Visual Studio Tools For Office runtime is not installed._

Download for VSTOR is here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f5539a90-dc41-4792-8ef8-f4de62ff1e81&displaylang=en" target="_blank">Visual Studio Too………</a>
  
Be sure to grab the one for the same language your Office installation is in, otherwise you’ll end up with the same error as above.
  
Supported version of Word is Professional Edition 2003, 2007 or 2010. Only 32-bit is supported!

Also, be sure that it is the Visual Studio 2005 Tools!
