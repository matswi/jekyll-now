Word is that we will se Opalis 6.3 on 25th of November. Support for installing on Windows server 2008 and integration packs for more System Center products is the news there.

When it comes to the vNext versions of both Opalis and OpsMgr they will probably be releases under the names System Center Opalis 2012 and System Center Operations Manager 2012.
