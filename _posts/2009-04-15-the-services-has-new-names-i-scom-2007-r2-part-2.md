I wrote a post about the name change of the Health Service in SCOM 2007 R2. Apparently there is a couple of more services that have changed name.   
The guys over at <http://www.systemcenterforum.org> got a post about that: [link](http://www.systemcenterforum.org/news/scom-r2-service-display-name-changes/)
