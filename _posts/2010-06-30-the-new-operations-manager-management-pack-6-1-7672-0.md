And a nice change is that they have made the rules that monitor failure of scripts, commands and WMI queries less noisy and easier to understand. The rules has also been renamed, new names is listed in the following table:

      <strong>Old name</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="295" valign="top">
      <strong>New name</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="295" valign="top">
      Alert on Failure to Create Process for Batch Response
    </td>
    
    <td width="295" valign="top">
      Workflow Initialization: Failed to start a process or script
    </td>
  </tr>

    </td>
  </tr>

    </td>
    
    <td width="295" valign="top">

    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="295" valign="top">

    </td>
  </tr>

    </td>
