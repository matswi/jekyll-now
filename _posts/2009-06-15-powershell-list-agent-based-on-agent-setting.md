Based on the data you get from the cmdlet _get-agent_ you can list all agents with a specific setting.

This line for example, will list all agents with the Agent Proxy setting enabled:   
_get-agent | where {$_.ProxyingEnabled -like $true}_

Change _$_.ProxyingEnabled_ to _$_.ManuallyInstalled_ and youâ€™ll get a list with all manually installed agents.

In OM2007 SP1 there is a bug on updating the ManuallyInstalled property, so that wont work. This is corrected in R2.   
If you dont have to use powershell there is a workaround in [this thread](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/operationsmanagerdeployment/thread/78f93ce1-deaf-4188-87eb-6700d98f22f4).
